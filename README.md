<br>

## Introduction

<br>
The **Quantum Computational Energy Dissipation Theory (QCED Theory)** posits that the energy loss in a computational system due to quantum dynamic interactions is a complex function of the system's current quantum state, the complexity of the computational task being performed, and the intrinsic quantum properties of the materials involved. This theory further asserts that there exists a calculable threshold beyond which a computational task's energy consumption becomes inefficient, potentially leading to excessive physical energy usage and system inefficiencies.
