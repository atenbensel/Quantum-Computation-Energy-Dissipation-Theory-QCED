# Quantum-Computation-Energy-Dissipation-Theory-QCED
The Quantum Computational Energy Dissipation Theory (QCED Theory) posits that the energy loss in a computational system due to quantum dynamic interactions is a complex function of the system's current quantum state, the complexity of the computational task being performed, and the intrinsic quantum properties of the materials involved.
